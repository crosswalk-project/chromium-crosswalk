Create an empty google-play-services.jar inside src/third_party/android_tools.

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/c/247861 has introduced a check in
android_tools.gyp that makes the gyp configuration process fail if a certain
file that is part of the Google Play Services library is not found.

Since installing that library involves manually accepting an EULA and it is not
used in Crosswalk, we create an empty file with the name android_tools.gyp
checks for so that the build configuration proceeds. If the user chooses to
manually install the library, the empty file is just overwritten and nothing
breaks. Additionally, we also create res/ and src/ so that src/build/java.gypi
can call find(1) in those directories without failing.
